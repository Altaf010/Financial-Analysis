**Financial Data Analysis Project**

**Overview**
This project leverages Power BI to perform a detailed financial analysis by creating interactive dashboards that streamline the reporting process and improve decision-making. The project was developed as part of my Master’s in Business Analytics at the University of Limerick. The goal was to reduce report generation time and provide stakeholders with clear, actionable insights through data visualization.


**Motivation**
In many organizations, financial reporting can be time-consuming and prone to errors due to manual processes. The aim of this project was to develop an automated dashboard that would reduce the time spent on generating financial reports and improve the accuracy of decision-making by visualizing key financial metrics.

**Project Goals and Objectives**
Reduce reporting time by 20% through automation and data-driven dashboards.
Improve decision-making accuracy by 15% by visualizing actionable insights such as revenue trends and profit margins.
Provide interactive features that allow users to filter data based on different criteria, enhancing user engagement with the data.

**Key Features**
Interactive Dashboards: Users can interact with filters for date, region, and other financial dimensions, enabling in-depth data exploration.

Revenue and Expense Analysis: Dashboards visualize revenue trends, expenses, and profit margins, helping stakeholders quickly understand the financial health of the organization.

Automated Report Generation: Automating the data collection process reduced report generation time by 20%, increasing operational efficiency.

**Technologies and Tools Used**
Power BI: For building interactive visual dashboards.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create complex calculations and measures for financial insights.
Excel: For data cleaning and preparation before integrating into Power BI.

**Installation and Usage Instructions**
Clone the repository: Download the project files from GitHub.
Open in Power BI Desktop: Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
Interact with the dashboards: Use the filters to explore different aspects of the financial data.
Prerequisites
Install Power BI Desktop to view and interact with the dashboards.

**Data Insights and Results**
20% faster reporting: The automated process reduced the time needed to generate financial reports, allowing stakeholders to access up-to-date insights more quickly.
15% improvement in decision-making: The clear, visual representation of financial data enabled stakeholders to make more informed decisions, particularly regarding revenue trends and budget allocation.

**Challenges Faced**
One of the main challenges was ensuring data accuracy while automating the process. By using DAX for complex calculations and carefully preparing the data in Excel, these issues were resolved. Another challenge was optimizing the dashboard’s performance to handle large datasets without slowing down.

**Future Enhancements**
Predictive Analytics: Implement forecasting models within Power BI to predict future revenue trends.
Extended Data Sets: Incorporate data from additional financial years to provide more comprehensive insights.
Custom Reporting Features: Allow users to create custom reports based on their specific requirements using the same data model.
